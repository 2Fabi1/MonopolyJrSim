# MonopolyJrSim
Was playing Monopoly Junior on discord camera with my friends, but then I realised, the game basically plays itself... so I made this, to no longer spend 1.5h on moving around pieces and throwing die.
Required modules: Random, Math, Time
Modify the time.sleep in print_with_delay function to change the smoothness
